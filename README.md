# Decoders For DDLC `.chr` Files
> Browsing this repo may spoil major plot points of [the game DDLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/). I'll do my best to keep the readme clean of direct references. The actual files are not provided. If you know, you know.

## Usage
Anyway, it has one decoder for the 4 types of files in the game. It is used as follows
```sh
python main <character> <path to file>
```

Where `<character>` is the type of decoder you want to use and `<path to file>` the path to the `*.chr` file.

There is also an option which is a WIP that allows you filter poem words by any criteria.
```sh
python main poems
```
